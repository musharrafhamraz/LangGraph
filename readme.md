# LangGraph Projects

Welcome to the **LangGraph Projects Repository**! This repo contains various projects, demos, and starter code using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications on top of LangChain.

---

## 🔰 Starter Code

The [`starter/`](starter/) directory contains the minimal setup to get started with LangGraph:

- `main.py`: A simple LangGraph example showing node creation and basic state transitions.
- `requirements.txt`: All required dependencies.

To run the starter code:

```bash
cd starter
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
📁 Projects
Project Name	Description
chat_assistant/	A multi-turn conversational assistant using memory and multiple agents.
document_routing/	An intelligent router that directs documents to the right agent based on type.
tools_agent/	A LangGraph agent that uses external tools (e.g., search, calculator) within a graph.
task_decomposition/	A project that shows how LangGraph breaks down complex tasks into subtasks with agents.
qa_pipeline/	A question-answering pipeline that reads context and returns refined answers.

Each project folder includes:

README.md – Project-specific instructions.

graph.py – The LangGraph setup.

utils.py – Helper functions or tools used in the graph.

main.py – The runnable entry point for the project.
